# Birthday Paradox

Mini Project: monte carlo simulation of the birthday paradox

## Summary

Provides a basic implementation for running eperiments using monte carlo simulation.

The example used is the birthday paradox; less of a paradox and more of a counterintuitive result of the likelihood of a room full of people sharing a birthday.

Ultimately, it's just a combinatorics problem, but solving it that way would be less fun.

## Requirements

the project has no dependencies.

## Running

In the terminal, navigate to the repo directory and run:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Future Work

- [ ] add additional experiments
- [ ] extract out the experiment setup and generalise in a seperate file
- [ ] provide a loop so users can run multiple experiments
- [ ] provide functionality for generating plots for a range of samples sizes
