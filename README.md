# Birthday Paradox

Mini Project: monte carlo simulation of the birthday paradox

## Summary

Provides a basic implementation for running eperiments using monte carlo simulation.

The example used is the birthday paradox; less of a paradox and more of a counterintuitive result of the likelihood of a room full of people sharing a birthday.

Ultimately, it's just a combinatorics problem, but solving it that way would be less fun.
